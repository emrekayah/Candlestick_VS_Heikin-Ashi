#### In this project, I coded a dashbord that allows comparing two financial charting methods. 
#### ◎ The First one is Candlestick------> the Candlestick pattern is the world's most widely used financial charting method.
#### ◎ The Second one is Heikin-Ashi--->Heikin-Ashi is a Japanese trading indicator that means "average pace". Heikin-Ashi charts resemble candlestick charts, but have a smoother appearance as they track a range of price movements, rather than tracking every price movement as with candlesticks. Heikin-Ashi was created in the 1700s by Munehisa Homma, who also created the candlestick chart. 

#### I'm talking about the libraries I use while doing this. 

#### ❗️You can write all financial stocks and cryptocurrencies in the symbol part, it is very important to write their codes correctly.
